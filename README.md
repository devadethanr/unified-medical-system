# unified-medical-system
 This project envisions a unified medical system for India that streamlines healthcare delivery and disease management. It allows for data sharing, appointment booking, and medical record access, all in one place. Additionally, a patient support chatbot empowers users and provides education. The system also utilizes machine learning to analyze patient symptoms from various regions, enabling early detection of potential viral outbreaks and pandemics. This unified approach aims to improve public health in India by enhancing efficiency, promoting data-driven disease surveillance, and empowering patients.
